<h1>Pikachu side-scroller written in Python</h1>
<i>Game only has the one short level at this time.</i>
<br>
<br>
<p>This is a short and simple side scroller game written in Python primarily using the <i>pygame</i> Python library. The game features Pikachu and Blastoise sprites (you can replace any of the images used with other images to change the look of the game). Basic enemy movement / attacks are functional, along with two different kinds of attacks for Pikachu, forward/backward movement, and jumping.</p>

<h2>How to start the game:</h2>
<br>
<p>Download .zip folder (or use other method), and run the main.py file. This should start the game, although I am currently running some tests because the game seems to malfunction when using certain versions of Python 3.</p>

<pre>python main.py</pre>

<i>Will add more to this...</i>
